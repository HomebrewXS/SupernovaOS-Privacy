# Information

This version is currently not maintained anymore. You can still request a version of SupernovaOS Privacy, you cannot get the Qt QML version of SupernovaOS due to open source licenses. You will get the HTML, CSS Version of SupernovaOS. 
For custom changes and features for SupernovaOS Qt QML we will have to release the source code on a different repository!
